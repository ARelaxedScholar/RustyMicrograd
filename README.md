# Rusty Micrograd: A Foray into AI with Rust üöÄ

Ahoy, Rustaceans and AI Enthusiasts!

Welcome aboard our Rusty Micrograd voyage‚Äîa project where we melded Rust's prowess with the mystique of neural networks.

### Our Quest üß≠

Rusty Micrograd is our humble attempt to build a miniature version of a neural network library from the ground up in Rust. The journey was inspired by the quest for understanding‚Äîpeering into the abyss of AI and hoping to catch a glimpse of its heart through the lens of Rust's safety and speed.

- **Why Rust?** For its fearless concurrency and memory safety guarantees. We were intrigued by the idea of leveraging Rust's capabilities to manage the intricate dance of neural networks.
- **The Challenge:** Neural networks are complex beasts. Simplifying them into a project manageable by a person as a over-the-weekend thing was no small feat. Still we managed somehow.

### Chronicles of Development üìñ

Our journey wasn't just about coding. It was a saga of learning, stumbling, and sometimes, downright failing. But every error message, every segfault was a step towards our goal.

- **Building the Foundation:** We started with an automatic differentiation engine, the bedrock upon which neural networks stand. It was a deep dive into calculus and Rust, often at the same time.
- **Layer by Layer:** Like constructing a galleon plank by plank, we built our neural network layer by layer. Each layer added was a triumph, a testament to our growing understanding and skill.

### Ashore for Now üèùÔ∏è

As we moor Rusty Micrograd, it's with a sense of accomplishment and anticipation. The project is in a state we're proud of, but like any good adventure, there's always more to explore. For now, we're taking a breather, but Rusty Micrograd isn't abandoned‚Äîjust resting before the next leg of the journey.

#### Room for improvements
- **I am you!:** Cloning... To clone or not to clone? That is the question that we totally ignored, this project makes profuse use of cloning, we shall return to it at some later point to see where they can be avoided.
- **Comments and Documentation:** As we wrote this, the main focus was to dish out a working implementation, hence documentation was in good french *le cadet de nos soucis*, hence some day in the future this will have to be done.
- **Optimization Utilities:** While rusty micrograd provides backward, forward and a way to access all the parameters in the model, no optimization method were written. 
- **A Call to Arms:** If you're intrigued by the siren call of AI and Rust, Rusty Micrograd awaits. Your contributions, your insights could be what sets the sails again.

### Charting the Next Course ‚öì

Rusty Micrograd is a testament to curiosity, to learning, and to the joy of building something from scratch. It's a project closed for now, to be revisited when the winds are favorable, and the stars align.

As we part ways, remember: the world of AI and Rust is vast and filled with mysteries waiting to be unraveled. Keep exploring, keep learning, and who knows? Maybe our paths will cross again on the high seas of code.
Also, whoever said Rust would replace Python in data science lied, I cannot see a world where data scientist would abandon the comfy and efficient land of python for the higly legislated, clean but inconvenient streets of rust.
Despite it all, this was a truly fun project.

Till we meet again.
